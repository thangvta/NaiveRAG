A Comprehensive Note on Building Naive RAG
Build a Naive RAG pipeline from scratch. With implementation of some latest Advanced RAG approaches.
In this note, I will explain how to:
ðŸ’» Develop a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based LLM application from scratch with LlamaIndex, VectorDB Weaviate, and Gemini
âœ…Evaluate different configurations of RAG system
ðŸš€ Implement some Advanced RAG components: Semantic Chunking, Hierachical Node Parsing, Hybrid Search
ðŸ”€ Implement latest approaches in improving RAG performance: Self RAG, Corrective RAG
